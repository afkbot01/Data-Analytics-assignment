    "# Theoretical Questions with Answers\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Difference between interpreted and compiled languages**: Interpreted languages execute code line-by-line (e.g., Python), whereas compiled languages translate code into machine language before execution (e.g., C).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Exception handling in Python**: It allows you to handle runtime errors using `try`, `except`, `else`, and `finally` blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Purpose of `finally` block**: It is always executed after `try` and `except`, used for cleanup actions like closing files or releasing resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Logging in Python**: A module to track events during a programâ€™s execution, useful for debugging and monitoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **`__del__` method**: Destructor method called when an object is about to be destroyed.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **`import` vs `from ... import`**: `import` imports the entire module; `from` imports specific parts of the module.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Multiple exceptions handling**: Use multiple `except` blocks or a tuple of exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Purpose of `with` statement**: Ensures proper acquisition and release of resources like file streams.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Multithreading vs multiprocessing**: Multithreading uses threads (shared memory), multiprocessing uses processes (separate memory space).\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Advantages of logging**: Helps track issues, audit operations, and debug efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. **Memory management in Python**: Done via reference counting and garbage collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. **Exception handling steps**: Identify risky code, use `try`, handle with `except`, optionally use `else` and `finally`.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. **Importance of memory management**: Prevents memory leaks and ensures efficient resource use.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. **Role of `try` and `except`**: `try` block holds code that might fail, `except` handles exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "15. **Python's garbage collection**: Automatically deletes unused objects using reference counting and generational GC.\n",
    "\n",
    "16. **Purpose of `else` in exception handling**: Executes if no exception occurs in `try` block.\n",
    "\n",
    "17. **Logging levels**: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL.\n",
    "\n",
    "18. **`os.fork()` vs multiprocessing**: `os.fork()` creates a child process in Unix, `multiprocessing` is platform-independent.\n",
    "\n",
    "19. **Importance of closing files**: Prevents data loss and resource leakage.\n",
    "\n",
    "20. **`file.read()` vs `file.readline()`**: `read()` reads the whole file; `readline()` reads line by line.\n",
    "\n",
    "21. **Logging module use**: To record messages during program execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "22. **`os` module in file handling**: For tasks like path handling, checking file existence, and file operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "23. **Challenges in memory management**: Memory leaks, circular references, and improper resource cleanup.\n",
    "\n",
    "24. **Raising exception manually**: Use `raise Exception(\"message\")`.\n",
    "\n",
    "25. **Importance of multithreading**: Useful for I/O-bound tasks to improve performance.\n"
